# CS4278-SoulfulSwaps

A peer of ours approached our team looking to develop an exchange-based clothing marketplace application. Our client has a large, established social media following, and is hoping to convert some of her following into users of this marketplace application. A large portion of the branding of this marketplace will be focused on the sustainability benefits of finding new clothes through a carbon-zero exchange rather than going out and buying new clothing, which contributes to unsustainable practices in the fashion industry.

The marketplace serves as the host of these exchanges, while not actually mediating any of the exchange process itself. This is accomplished through robust location and chat features in the platform, which allow users to coordinate and execute transactions independently. The marketplace is currently an iOS based application, but will hopefully be able to be ported across mobile operating systems eventually.

Since this is an iOS application, it is largely be built using Swift. It also uses Firebase Realtime Database. 

## The application currently contains the following features:
  * Authentication using email and Facebook (sign-up and login)
  * Closets for each user that contain their clothing items.
    - Users can add, remove, or edit items in their own closets
  * A marketplace that shows other users' items that are available for exchange
  * Buttons for initiating, accepting, or declining exchange offers
  * Messaging to negotiate and arrange exchanges
  
  #### We hope you enjoy the application!
